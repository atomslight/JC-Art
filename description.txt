Challenges faced: I tried installing open sora on various systems though it was not easy and at the end when i launched it, it did'nt work out always asked about if i had Nvidia graphics driver,
for this reason i left open sora and, switched to stable-diffusion for generating frames of my image for video and finally integrated it with gradio UI by combining each frame using moviepy and display it on gradio UI.

To create the "Surrealism/Cubism/Impressionism Art Video Generator,

" I leveraged the Stable Diffusion model for generating artistic images based on uploaded image and text prompts. I combined this with Gradio for the user interface and MoviePy for video creation from the generated images. 



The project was divided into four components:

1. Setting up the model:

->The model works on a pretrained model stablediffusion for generating image frames.

->After it the model is set to load on to the gpu for better performance and faster processing using  (pipe.to("cuda"))

2. Generation of Image:

Based on the style prompt and input image the model. The function utilizes the Stable Diffusion pipeline, tweaking guidance scale.

3.Video Creation:

The create_video() function generates a sequence of frames with gradual transitions between styles (surrealism, cubism, impressionism) from prompt and integrates them into a video. 

4.Gradio Integration:

I used Gradio to create a simple web interface where users can upload an image and provide a style prompt.
